Customer Churn Prediction: A Comprehensive Overview
Customer Churn: Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company, leading to revenue loss and increased acquisition costs.

Churn Scenarios:

Dissatisfaction: Customers may churn due to poor product-market fit, lack of features, poor quality, or subpar customer service.
Pricing Concerns: High prices, hidden fees, or poor perceived value can drive customers away.
Competition: Attractive offers from competitors can lure customers away.
Life Events: Changes in financial situations, relocation, or evolving needs can lead to churn.
Involuntary Churn: Failed payments or fraud can cause involuntary churn.
Lack of Engagement: Customers who don't see the value or don't actively use the product may churn.
Subscriber Decision Cycle: The journey from awareness to churn or renewal, influenced by factors like product quality, pricing, customer service, competition, and personal circumstances.

Churn Segments: Groups of customers with similar churn reasons, such as price-sensitive, product-dissatisfied, competitor-driven, involuntary, low-engagement, high-value, or early churners.
